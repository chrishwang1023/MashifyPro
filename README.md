Mashify Pro is a program that emulates a dj pad. A dj pad is used to remix, mashup, and produce songs. An example of a dj pad can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y4bZaLMsIQ. Desired sounds can be stored into a box on the board and when pressed, the sounds are looped. To the functions available to the actual dj board, I added a recording function that allows users to create actual recordings of their voices to make an acoustic remix of songs that would like. Additionally, users can create own compositions using recordings of their voices or instruments. 

The program will first run into a main menu screen. There, users can either load a project they had been working on, read instructions, or go directly to a new project by clicking on the Mashify button. 

In Mashify, the users can choose how many sounds they would like on the board by clicking the plus or the minus buttons. That will adjust the board size and the number of sounds available on the board. There are multiple ways of storing sounds into the boxes on the board. 

First, users can record their own sounds. In order to do so, users will press the Make Sound button. Only then will they be able to click the Record button. The boxes next to the buttons will be colored to indicate that the buttons have been clicked. Before recording, the users must put in one of two information: either music structure or time. The music structure includes beats per minute (BPM), meter (out of 4), and the number of measure or bars they will be recording. The time is measured in seconds. The users will then include the file name that they will be recording. In order to actually record now, the users will click on the desired box on the board that they would like to store that recording audio. After recording, the box will be colored yellow. A colored box means that the audio is on. If the box is clicked again, the color will disappear, indicating that the sound is off and will not be played. That enables which sounds you want to play and which sounds you would like to mute out. 

Next, users can load sounds from preexisting files in their computer. The file must be a wave file and the users simply have to input the file name and the desired section of the audio they would like to put in their board (by putting the start and end time in seconds). 
	
Another feature to put sounds is by streaming from SoundCloud. The users will put in the embed number of the desired SoundCloud audio link and again, put the desired section of the audio they would like to put into their board. This will work with internet connection.  

Users can delete any sound they like by clicking the delete button then clicking the box they would like to get rid of. Users can save the file and load it back any time they want in the main menu screen. 

Users can now make music with their own sounds, preexisting sounds, and actual music from SoundCloud!
